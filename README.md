# 🎛️ **Hand Gesture Volume Control**

This project implements a hand gesture-based volume control system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. The application tracks the position of your hand and adjusts the system volume based on the distance between your thumb and index finger.

## **🛠️ Requirements**

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries installed:

- **OpenCV** `cv2`
- **MediaPipe** `mediapipe`
- **PyAutoGUI** `pyautogui`

You can install the required libraries using **pip**:

**-> pip install opencv-python**

**-> pip install mediapipe**

**-> pip install pyautogui**


## **🎮 How to Use**

- Run the Script: Start the script and ensure your webcam is active.

- Gesture Control: Pinch your thumb and index finger together to decrease the volume. Move your thumb and index finger apart to increase the volume.
